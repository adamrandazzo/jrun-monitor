Monitor JRUN CPU Usage - Coldfusion Watcher

I have had the unfortunate experience of administering a Coldfusion server. Often times, JRUN would hang for no particular reason and it would require a manual restart. This is a simple script that will monitor the CPU usage of JRUN. If it is over 50% for a period of 1 minute straight, it will kill the process.
